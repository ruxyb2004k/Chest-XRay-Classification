# Classification of chest X-ray scans

The aim of this project is to classify chest X-ray scans coming from patients suffering from COVID or pneumonia, or from healthy subjects (control). For the classification, deep learning using convolutional neuronal networks (CNN) was used. More specifically, a pre-trained model, VGG-16, was modified and employed by using transfer learning.
